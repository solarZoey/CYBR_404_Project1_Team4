# EXECUTIVE DESIGN
## INTRODUCTION
<br> This document aims to provide the design for a basic calculator program that conducts both basic and advanced calculations. The calculator will be a simple Java program that will interact with the user and conduct error handling, calculate what needs to be calculated and validate the input entered by the user.
## OVERVIEW
<br> The Java Calculator program will be a easy to use mathematical tool, that will allow useers to perform calculations, view history, clear their history and all in all manage their calculation results.
## COMPONENTS
### Interface
- User will enter the mathematical expressions that they need
- The interface will be where calculations will be shown
- Error messages will also be displayed on the interface
- The user interface will be where previous calculations will be displayed
- The user interface will also be where user can select the operations they aim to use
### Basic Operations Module
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
### Advanced Operations
- Logarithmic Fubctions
- Trigonometric Functions
- Square Root
### Storage Processor (History Tracking)
- Stores all the calculations temporarily
- Gives the user the ability to be able to get the stored calculations
- User can manage storage process or by clearing the stored information
### Error Handling
- Validates the user input
- Checks calculations to make sure there are no errors or that user is entering the right input
- Outputs the appropriate error messages
