# Day 1 (Saturday):
- Today, I started the calculator project! I set up the folders to keep everything organized. Then, I created a class called BasicOperations to handle all the math stuff like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. I also made an InputValidator to check if the user types in valid numbers (no weird inputs allowed!). Finally, I began working on the main Calculator class, which will tie everything together.

# Day 2 (Monday):
-   Created the main Calculator class with a menu for operations. Added history for the last 100 calculations. Found a bug in the logarithm function it needed two inputs but only got one
# Day 3 (Wednesday):
- I fixed a bug in the logarithm function it wasnâ€™t working because it needed a second number, and I forgot to add that. Oops!
- Made the InputValidator class to check user inputs. It ensures numbers are valid and integers are within a range.
# Day 4 (Thursday):
Tested all operations.The calculator now works smoothly without crashing.
