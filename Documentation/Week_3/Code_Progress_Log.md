# Day 1 (Saturday):
- Today, I started the calculator project! I set up the folders to keep everything organized. Then, I created a class called BasicOperations to handle all the math stuff like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. I also made an InputValidator to check if the user types in valid numbers (no weird inputs allowed!). Finally, I began working on the main Calculator class, which will tie everything together.

# Day 2 (Monday):
- I finished the main Calculator class today! I added a menu so users can easily pick what they want to do (like adding numbers or checking the square root). I also added all the math operations, including some advanced ones like exponents.  

# Day 3 (Wednesday):
- I fixed a bug in the logarithm function it wasnâ€™t working because it needed a second number, and I forgot to add that. Oops!
