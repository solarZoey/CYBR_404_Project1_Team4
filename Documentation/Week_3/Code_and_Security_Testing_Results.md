# Code and Security Testing Results

- The Calculator app was tested for memory safety, input protection, math accuracy, and ease of use. All issues were fixed, and the program is now more secure and user-friendly.

# Security Testing
*Memory Safety
Status: Fixed

- The app now clears all data properly when exiting.
- Sensitive data is overwritten before being deleted.
  

# Input Protection: Fixed

- The app now blocks invalid inputs (like letters or symbols).
- Added checks for very large or small numbers.

# Code Testing
Math Accuracy
Status: Working

- All math operations (+, -, *, /, etc.) give correct results.
- Edge cases (like dividing by zero) are handled well.
- Results are displayed clearly (e.g., whole numbers show as integers).

# Logic and History
Status: Fixed

- Prompts now clearly explain what to enter (e.g., "Enter numerator:").
- History shows full calculations (e.g., "63 / 7 = 9.0" instead of just "/ = 9.0").

# User Interface
Status: Improved

- Menu is easy to use.
- Added confirmations for clearing history.
- Error messages are clear and helpful.

# Overall
- The app now works well, is secure, and is easier to use. All major issues have been fixed.
