## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose: 

Our team (Team Super Nova) noticed that the global software ecosystem was lacking a preponderance of free software-based calculators.  Our team saw this as an issue, an issue that we have taken upon ourselves to fix.  Our calculator will fill this gap in the relevant ecosystem, thus allowing anyone from school age children to accountants or corporate officers to be able to do necessary calculations without having to pay for its use or have persistent connection to the internet.

### Scope:
This calculator will be able to do simple arithmetic as well as finding square roots.  It will have an inviting “bubbly” interface that feels warm and chocolatey.

### Methodology:
Team Super Nova will be using waterfall as the sole SDLC for this project which we have dubbed “S.T.E.V.E.N - Error 404 – The Offline Calculator”.

### Key Technologies:
Team Super Nova will be using Java as the primary coding language for this project.  The platform we will be using will be GitHub, as this is required by Sir Adam Spanier.

### Upcoming Milestone:
Phase 2: Design – Expected completion: 3/3/25

Key Decision Needed: Yes, Team Super Nova still needs to make all design decisions. (UML diagrams to come)



## 6. Conclusion & Recommendations

Team Super Nova is on track to complete the project on time on 2/31/25, to remain this status it is recommended that the team institutes a weekday evening as well as one on the weekends to coordinate and communicate status and hurdles amongst themselves as well as maintaining open lines of communication with Sir Adam Spanier.
