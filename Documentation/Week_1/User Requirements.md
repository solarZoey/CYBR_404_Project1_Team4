**What do the users require for the system to work? How will they access the system?**
- Users need a device capable of running Java applications (like a computer, phone, or tablet). The calculator will work as long as the computer has basic java compatability. Additionally, users should understand basic calculator functions (e.g., addition, subtraction) to interact with the system effectively.
